2. Create a new project
3. Go to Supabase's "SQL Editor", paste the following code into the editor and **click run**

```sql
CREATE TABLE "public"."spotify" (
    "id" text NOT NULL,
    "appleMusicID" int8 NOT NULL,
    "url" text,
    "downloaded" bool DEFAULT false,
    "created_at" timestamptz DEFAULT now(),
    PRIMARY KEY ("id")
);

2. **Put it under the project root** , use `tar` to unpack it, rename the unpacked folder to `ffmpeg`

```bash
tar -xf ffmpeg-release-amd64-static.tar.xz
```

3. Make sure your FFmpeg version is higher than `5.0.0`, you can check it by running `./ffmpeg/ffmpeg -version`

### Start the server

Simply run

```bash
node server.js
```

If you want to make sure that the server is always running, you can run pm2 to manage it.

```bash
pm2 start server.js --name spotify-animated-artwork-server
```

### Start you caddy server to reverse proxy and use https

Copy `Caddydile.example` to `Caddyfile` and replace `https://your-domain.example.com` with your domain.

If you are using Cloudflare to manager your domain DNS, replace `your_cloudflare_api_key` with your Cloudflare api key. Otherwise, checkout [Caddy Documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/) for other ways to enable HTTPS.

Note: HTTPS is needed for this api to work.

```bash
caddy start --config Caddyfile
```

## Develop

You need to run this command every time you want to make changes effecting Spotify (probably).

```bash
npm run build && spicetify apply --enable-developer-mode
```

Enable developer mode to open console, deactivate every time you close Spotify.

```bash
spicetify enable-devtools --enable-developer-mode
```
